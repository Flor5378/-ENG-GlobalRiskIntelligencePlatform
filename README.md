# Global Risk Intelligence Platform

## Overview
The **Global Risk Intelligence Platform** is an OSINT-driven, real-time data ingestion, processing, storage, and alerting system for monitoring global risks such as natural disasters, protests, armed conflicts, industrial accidents, cyber incidents, and more.  
It aggregates multi-domain open-source data, normalizes and enriches it, applies machine learning for classification and risk scoring, stores it for historical analysis, and provides real-time visualization and alerting via dashboards, APIs, and notifications.  

**Goal:** Turn scattered public data into structured, actionable intelligence accessible via web, mobile (Android), and desktop (.exe).

## Ingestion Layer

Robust, fault-tolerant data collectors aggregate raw data continuously.

### Methods
- **Async collectors:** Python `aiohttp` / `httpx` polling APIs concurrently with exponential backoff and retries.
- **Scrapers:** `Scrapy` & `Playwright` for dynamic and static HTML extraction, respecting robots.txt.
- **Webhooks:** FastAPI microservices receiving push notifications from sources supporting callbacks.
- **Social media streams:** Persistent WebSocket connections to Twitter/X, Reddit Live, Mastodon with keyword/location filtering.
- **Geospatial Feed Processing:** Real-time GeoJSON, KML, GPX normalization to WGS84 lat/lon.
- **Media Handling:** Download and deduplicate images/videos with metadata extraction.

### Workflow
- Raw data published to Kafka topic `raw-events` with metadata headers (`source_id`, `fetched_at`, `license`, etc.).
- Compression with LZ4 and partitioning by `source_id` ensure throughput and parallelism.
- Fault tolerance with Dead Letter Queues (`dlq-raw-events`), checkpoints, and health monitoring.

   - Embedding generation for semantic search.

3. **Machine Learning Scoring**  
   - Event classification by domain (disaster, protest, etc.).  
   - Severity scoring (0-100) based on historical, geospatial, and sentiment features.  
   - Escalation probability predictions.

4. **Alert Routing**  
   - Triggers alerts via Slack, Telegram, Email, and webhooks based on thresholds.  
   - Deduplicates alerts and rate-limits.

## Machine Learning

- **Classification:**  
  Use text-based multi-label classification models to categorize events.  
  - Baseline: TF-IDF vectorization combined with LightGBM for fast and interpretable results.  
  - Advanced: Fine-tune transformer models like BERT for improved context understanding and accuracy.  
  - Output: Probabilities for multiple event categories (e.g., disaster, protest, cyber incident).

- **Severity Scoring:**  
  Predict event severity using gradient boosting models (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM) trained on:  
  - Text-derived features (sentiment scores, keyword counts)  
  - External features like population density, historical event severity in the region  
  - Temporal features (time of day, seasonality)  
  - Output: A continuous severity score used for alert thresholds and prioritization.

- **Anomaly Detection:**  
  Detect unusual patterns or sudden changes in event streams:  
  - Algorithms: Isolation Forest to identify outliers in feature space.  
  - Change Point Detection on time-series event counts to flag shifts in event frequency or type.  
  - Enables early warnings for emerging crises or unexpected incidents.

- **Trend Prediction:**  
  Forecast near-future event volumes or severity trends using time-series models:  
  - Facebook Prophet for handling seasonality and holidays in data.  
  - ARIMA models for short-term forecasting and baseline comparison.  
  - Supports proactive resource allocation and risk management.

- **Clustering:**  
  Group related events for summarization and noise reduction:  
  - Generate semantic embeddings of event text (e.g., Sentence-BERT).  
  - Use density-based clustering like HDBSCAN to identify clusters of similar events without predefining number of clusters.  
  - Helps in event deduplication and identifying evolving incidents.

## Observability & Compliance

- **Metrics:**  
  Implement monitoring with Prometheus to collect:  
  - Kafka consumer lag and throughput for ingestion pipelines.  
  - Latency of API calls and data processing steps.  
  - ML inference time per event to detect bottlenecks.  
  Visualize metrics in Grafana dashboards with alerts on anomalies.

- **Logging:**  
  Centralize logs using the ELK stack:  
  - Logstash for collecting and parsing logs from all services.  
  - Elasticsearch for indexing and searching logs.  
  - Kibana for real-time log visualization and troubleshooting.  
  Logs include error traces, event processing status, and security audits.

- **Data Quality:**  
  Enforce strict schema validation at ingestion and normalization stages:  
  - Validate required fields, data types, and value ranges.  
  - Track missing or malformed fields and generate data quality reports.  
  - Automate alerts on data quality degradation to maintain pipeline reliability.

- **Drift Detection:**  
  Continuously monitor model input feature distributions and output predictions:  
  - Statistical tests (e.g., KL divergence) to detect input data drift.  
  - Track prediction confidence and class distribution shifts.  
  - Trigger retraining or investigation when drift exceeds thresholds.

- **Compliance:**  
  Ensure ethical and legal compliance by:  
  - Respecting Terms of Service (ToS) of data sources; avoid scraping where disallowed.  
  - Anonymizing Personally Identifiable Information (PII) to protect privacy.  
  - Maintaining records of data source licenses and usage rights.  
  - Auditing raw data access and processing steps for transparency and accountability.
